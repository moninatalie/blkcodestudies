* 3. What is the salience of the past (the history of slavery in this digital moment?
In this digital moment more than ever before, producers and writers search for inspiration to create the latest hit show that distinguishes itself from all others. Most noticeabely in recent years, writers have focused on revamping history in a new way that appeals to viewers like never before through new media platforms. This trend can be seen in both film and television series, with Selma, 12 Years a Slave, Lincoln, Django Unchanged, Pope Francis, the People v. O.J. Simpson, Downtown Abbey, The Crown, and in this case specifically, Underground. The salience of the history of slavery in this digital moment has proven particularly important as more studies and personal accounts of slavery have surfaced, and as the latest technologies have brought these personal experiences to life, looking almost completely realistic and believable on the big screen. Additionally, in the increasingly diverse and globally aware world we live in, it is important for writers and producers to take advantage of the salience of the past in order to understand how far we have developed historically from the times of slavery and the Civil Rights movemnet, but also how much room for improvement and acceptance remainds. It is also important to realize how these stories of racism and dehumanizing treatment does not exist far from our realities, and to ascertain how relatable these characters are.
